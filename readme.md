# React in a single file

## Purpose

Lightning-quick trying out of React stuff.

There are no servers to be run, no environments to install.

Everything is in a single file, so playing around and trying stuff out is easy.

## Requirements

- A web browser
- A text editor

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
1. Make a change to `index.html` and save the file
1. Reload the page in the browser

## Tips

- Use a syntax-aware editor
    - ideally one that recognizes React and JSX
    - if not, at least a one that knows how to color the html and/or JS syntax

- Turn on the developer console in your browser to explore the details
    - Chrome: `Alt+F12`

## Origin

The contents of `index.html` was copied from the [Try React](https://reactjs.org/docs/try-react.html) page, [Minimal HTML Template](https://reactjs.org/docs/try-react.html#minimal-html-template) section.
